# Churb.ro - A nasty little thing to test out push notifications

This is a simple web app that allows you to send push notifications to your browser. 
If you subscribe and push the button, it will send a notification to everyone else who has sent one previously. 
The key purpose for implementing such a shitty thing was to test out the push notification APIs in iOS and other web platforms.
There is a manifest file that allows you to add to your iOS home screen allowing for iOS 16.4 and newer to accept push notifications.

## How to use
Install the packages, make some vapid keys and pray. This is so awful, I'm not even going to bother telling you how to use it.

## What on earth does Chur mean?
The AI says - "Chur is a slang word used in New Zealand. It is a shortened version of the word "cheers" and is used to express gratitude or appreciation."
It has also been added to the Oxford English Dictionary, so it must be true.
